 ### Introduction ###
 
This Github page contains the code used for the project named above. This code includes two methods for preprocessing raw RNA-seq Fastq reads and converting them into count data for gene expression analysis!
 
 For further inquiries/questions, please contact Oluchi Aroh at olo0002@auburn.edu.
 
 ### Usage ### 
 
 Most programs used in this project are open-source. However, the following programs and their dependencies needs to be installed.
 
 + FASTQC        
 + Trimmomatic    
 + HiSAT2         
 + Samtools       
 + Gffread 
 + StringTie 
 + Subread
 
 
For Statistical analysis, the following program was run in R

 + Bioconductor/DeSeq2
 + MAplot
 + ggplot2
 + tidyverse
 
 ### Inputs/Outputs ###
 
Input and output files are specified in the codes using <>. Output of some program serve as an input file for other programs, hence attention should be paid to the last letter added to each output file name in the codes.
