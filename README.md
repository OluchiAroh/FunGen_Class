 ### Introduction ###
 
 This Github page contains the codes used in the project named above for Functional Genomics Class. 
 For further inquiries/questions, please contact Oluchi Oyekwe at olo0002@auburn.edu.
 
 ### Usage ### 
 
 Most programs used in this project are open-source. However, the following programs and their dependencies needs to be installed.
 
 + FASTQC         (https://github.com/genometools/genometools)
 + Trimmomatic    (https://github.com/oushujun/LTR_FINDER_parallel)
 + HiSAT2         (https://github.com/GSLBiotech/mafft)
 + Samtools       (https://github.com/Cibiv/IQ-TREE)
 + StringTie
 + Gffread 

For Satistical analysis, the following program was run in R

 + DeSeq2
 + MAplot
 
 ### Inputs/Outputs ###
 
 Input and output files are specified in the codes using <>. Output of some program serve as an input file for other programs, hence attention should be paid to the last letter added to each output file name in the codes.
